/*
 * Capsules creation
    There will be no protocol between Capsule and Spacecraft. The Spacecraft agent creates the Capsule agent. Therefore the names of all the capsule classes will be in the same format CapsuleX.java, where X is the team number. CapsuleX.java is located at the top level of the platform folder. 
    At the creation of the Capsule, the Spacecraft will provide the necessary information as arguments in this particular order:

    Landing of Capsule X-coordinate 
    Landing of Capsule Y-coordinate 
    Dimension of world X
    Dimension of world Y
