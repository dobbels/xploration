We start up a certain Registration Desk with registration period X. 

Case 1:
We send a request and get an AGREE and an INFORM

Case 2:
We send another request (within registration period) and get AGREE and FAILURE

Case 3:
We send rubbish and get NOT_UNDERSTOOD

Case 4:
We send another request outside of registration period and get REFUSE

To test the company:
Case 1: Put yourself in yellow pages, listen for company, start up company-agent and check if the message is in correct format and delivered within the registration period


Or does it have to be more blackbox? We start up a registration desk and agent and let them do their thing? 
Then we start up another agent with the same id and make sure it fails?
